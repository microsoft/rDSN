  @defgroup service-api-model Application and Framework Models
  @ingroup service-api-c

  The base interface (models) for applications and frameworks atop rDSN.
  In rDSN, both applications and frameworks must implement a base abstract
  called \ref dsn_app, which are registered into rDSN's service
  kernel via \ref dsn_register_app. 
  
  Here is an example where we register two applications into rDSN; note we
  use the C++ wrappers atop our C API in this example.

  <PRE>
  int main(int argc, char** argv)
  {
    // register all app types
    dsn::register_app<test_client>("test");
    dsn::register_app<test_server>("server");

    // run rDSN
    dsn_run(argc, argv, true);
    return 0;
  }
  </PRE>
  
  After the applications and frameworks are registered, developers specify 
  the concrete instances in config files, and rDSN creates them accordingly on start-up.

  <PRE>
  [apps.client]
  arguments = localhost 20101  
  delay_seconds = 1
  pools = THREAD_POOL_DEFAULT
  type = test
  
  [apps.server]  
  pools = THREAD_POOL_TEST_SERVER
  ports = 20101  
  type = server
  </PRE>

  Developers usually run this using ```./app config.ini```, or ```./app``` for more options.
